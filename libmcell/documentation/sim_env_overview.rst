Simulation Environment Overview
*******************************

MCell is an agent-based reaction-diffusion program that simulates the movement and interaction of molecules in 3D space. MCell 4 provides two different user experiences, one through its visual interface as an add-on in Blender 2.93, known as CellBlender, and the other one through a new python interface. MCell 4 provides the users with the flexibility to change between both experiences, and also supports the file format MDL that older versions of MCell had. Moreover, in the newly developed MCell 4, reactions can be written following BioNetGen syntax, and therefore models can be exported from MCell and imported in BioNetGen for simulation and vice versa, integrating two different simulation engines.
