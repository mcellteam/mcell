Color
=====

Represents color with alpha component.
Provides two means to set value, either red, green, blue and alpha, 
or rgba. If both color individual components and rgba are set in initialization,
the individual components are used.

Attributes:
***********
* | **red**: float = None
  | Red component in range 0-1.

* | **green**: float = None
  | Green component in range 0-1.

* | **blue**: float = None
  | Blue component in range 0-1.

* | **alpha**: float = 1
  | Alpha component in range 0-1. 1 means nontransparent.

* | **rgba**: int = 0
  | This attribute provides an alternative way of defining colors by supplying a 
  | 32-bit unsigned integer representation of the color with an aplha channel. 
  | In hexadecimal notation the first 2 digits are value for red, second 2 digits are 
  | green, third 2 digits are blue and the last two digits are alpha. 
  | The range for each component is thus 0x0-0xFF (0-255). 
  | Example\: 0x0000ffcc represents the same color as rgba(0, 0, 100%, 80%).
  | All values are valid.

GeometryObject
==============

Class represents geometry objects defined by triangular surface elements.

Example: `1330_get_wall/geometry.py <https://github.com/mcellteam/mcell_tests/blob/mcell4_dev/tests/pymcell4_positive/1330_get_wall/geometry.py>`_ 

Attributes:
***********
* | **name**: str
  | Name of the object. Also represents BNGL compartment name if 'is_bngl_compartment' is True.

* | **vertex_list**: List[List[float]]
  | List of [x,y,z] triplets specifying positions of individual vertices of each triangle.

* | **wall_list**: List[List[int]]
  | List of [a,b,c] triplets specifying each wall, individual values are indices into the 
  | vertex_list attribute.

* | **is_bngl_compartment**: bool = False
  | Set to True if this object represents a 3D BNGL compartment. 
  | Its name will be then the BNGL compartment name.

* | **surface_compartment_name**: str = None
  | When is_bngl_compartment is True, this attribute can be set to specify its 
  | membrane (2D) compartment name.

* | **surface_regions**: List[SurfaceRegion] = None
  | All surface regions associated with this geometry object.

* | **surface_class**: SurfaceClass = None
  | Surface class for the whole object's surface. It is applied to the whole surface of this object 
  | except for those surface regions that have their specific surface class set explicitly.

* | **initial_surface_releases**: List[InitialSurfaceRelease] = None
  | Each item in this list defines either density or number of molecules to be released on this surface 
  | regions when simulation starts.

* | **initial_color**: Color = None
  | Initial color for this geometry object. If a surface region has its color set, its value 
  | is used for the walls of that surface region.

* | **node_type**: RegionNodeType = RegionNodeType.UNSET
  | When this values is LeafGeometryObject, then this object is of class GeometryObject,
  | when LeafSurfaceRegion, then it is of class SurfaceRegion.

* | **left_node**: Region = None
  | Internal, do not use. When node_type is not Leaf, this is the left operand

* | **right_node**: Region = None
  | Internal, do not use. When node_type is not Leaf, this is the right operand


Methods:
*********
* | **translate**

   * | move: List[float]
     | 3D vector [x, y, z] that will be added to each vertex of this object.


  | Move object by a specified vector. 
  | Cannot be called after model was initialized.

  | Example: `1400_object_translate/model.py <https://github.com/mcellteam/mcell_tests/blob/mcell4_dev/tests/pymcell4_positive/1400_object_translate/model.py>`_ 


* | **__add__**

   * | other: Region
   * | return type: Region


  | Computes union of two regions, use with Python operator '+'.


* | **__sub__**

   * | other: Region
   * | return type: Region


  | Computes difference of two regions, use with Python operator '-'.


* | **__mul__**

   * | other: Region
   * | return type: Region


  | Computes intersection of two regions, use with Python operator '\*'.



Region
======

Represents region construted from 1 or more multiple, usually unnamed?

Attributes:

  | When this values is LeafGeometryObject, then this object is of class GeometryObject,
  | when LeafSurfaceRegion, then it is of class SurfaceRegion.

* | **left_node**: Region = None
  | Internal, do not use. When node_type is not Leaf, this is the left operand

* | **right_node**: Region = None
  | Internal, do not use. When node_type is not Leaf, this is the right operand


Methods:
*********

* | **__mul__**

   * | other: Region
   * | return type: Region


  | Computes intersection of two regions, use with Python operator '\*'.



SurfaceRegion
=============

Defines a region on the object. The extent of a region is given by the wall_indices list. 
Molecules can be added and surface properties can be set with the optional regional surface commands. 
You can have an arbitrary number of regions on an object, and they may overlap if
you wish. Molecules added to overlapping regions accumulate. Triangles belonging to 
multiple regions inherit all parent regionsâ€™ surface properties. Users
have to make sure that in case of overlapped regions their surface properties
are compatible.

Example: `1700_linear_conc_gradient_w_conc_clamp/geometry.py <https://github.com/mcellteam/mcell_tests/blob/mcell4_dev/tests/pymcell4_positive/1700_linear_conc_gradient_w_conc_clamp/geometry.py>`_ 

Attributes:
***********
* | **name**: str
  | Name of this region.

* | **wall_indices**: List[int]
  | Surface region must be a part of a GeometryObject, items in this list are indices to 
  | its wall_list array.

* | **surface_class**: SurfaceClass = None
  | Optional surface class assigned to this surface region.
  | If not set, it is inherited from the parent geometry object's surface_class.

* | **initial_surface_releases**: List[InitialSurfaceRelease] = None
  | Each item of this list defines either density or number of molecules to be released on this surface 
  | regions when simulation starts.

* | **initial_color**: Color = None
  | Initial color for this specific surface region. If not set, color of the parent's GeometryObject is used.

* | **node_type**: RegionNodeType = RegionNodeType.UNSET
  | When this values is LeafGeometryObject, then this object is of class GeometryObject,
  | when LeafSurfaceRegion, then it is of class SurfaceRegion.

* | **left_node**: Region = None
  | Internal, do not use. When node_type is not Leaf, this is the left operand

* | **right_node**: Region = None
