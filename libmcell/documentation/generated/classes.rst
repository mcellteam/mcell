Complex
=======

This class represents a complex molecule composed of molecule instances.
It is either defined using a BNGL string or using a list of elementary molecule instances.
On top of that, orientation may be defined.
This class is used as argument in cases where either a fully qualified instance or a pattern 
can be provided such as in observable Count.  
Comparison operator __eq__ first converts complexes to their canonical representation and 
then does comparison so for instance m.Complex('A(b!1).B(a!1)') == m.Complex('B(a!2).A(b!2)').

Attributes:
***********
* | **name**: str = None
  | When set, this complex instance is initialized from a BNGL string passed as this argument, 
  | the string is parsed during model initialization so the molecule types it uses
  | don't have to be defined before initialization.

* | **elementary_molecules**: List[ElementaryMolecule] = None
  | Individual molecule instances contained in the complex.

* | **orientation**: Orientation = Orientation.DEFAULT
  | Specifies orientation of a molecule. 
  | When Orientation.DEFAULT if kept then during model initialization is
  | 'orientation' set to Orientation.NONE for volume complexes and to 
  | Orientation.UP for surface complexes.
  | Ignored by derived class Species.

* | **compartment_name**: str = None
  | Specifies compartment name of this Complex. 
  | Only one of 'orientation' and 'compartment_name' can be set. 
  | If a 2D/surface compartment is specified, the complex must be a surface complex and 
  | orientation is set to Orientation.UP.
  | If a 3D/volume compartment is specified, the complex must be a volume complex and
  | orientation is set to Orientation.NONE. 
  | Ignored by derived class Species.

  | 1/sqrt(PI \* Sigma_s) where Sigma_s is the surface grid density 
  | (default or user-specified).

* | **intermembrane_interaction_radius**: float = None
  | Diffusing surface molecules will interact with surface molecules on other

  | 1/sqrt(PI \* Sigma_s) where Sigma_s is the surface grid density 
  | (default or user-specified).

* | **vacancy_search_distance**: float = 10
  | Normally, a reaction will not proceed on a surface unless there
  | is room to place all products on the single grid element where
  | the reaction is initiated. By increasing r from its default value
  | of 0, one can specify how far from the reactionâ€™s location, in microns, the
  | reaction can place its products. To be useful, r must
  | be larger than the longest axis of the grid element on the triangle
  | in question. The reaction will then proceed if there is room to
  | place its products within a radius r, and will place those products as 
  | close as possible to the place where the reaction occurs
  | (deterministically, so small-scale directional bias is possible).

* | **center_molecules_on_grid**: bool = False

* | **initial_partition_origin**: List[float] = None
  | Optional placement of the partition 0 placement, specifies the left, lower and front 
  | point. If not set, value -partition_dimension/2 is used for each of the dimensions

  | Enables check for overlapped walls. Overlapping walls can cause issues during 
  | simulation such as a molecule escaping closed geometry when it hits two walls 
  | that overlap.

* | **reaction_class_cleanup_periodicity**: int = 500
  | Reaction class cleanup removes computed reaction classes for inactive species from memory.
  | This provides faster reaction lookup faster but when the same reaction class is 
  | needed again, it must be recomputed.

* | **species_cleanup_periodicity**: int = 10000
  | Species cleanup removes inactive species from memory. It removes also all reaction classes 
  | that reference it.
  | This provides faster addition of new species lookup faster but when the species is 
  | needed again, it must be recomputed.

  | Enables sorting of molecules for diffusion, this may improve cache locality.
  | Produces different results when enabled.

  | after initialization right before the first event is started. 
  | When not set, the set 'seed' value is used to initialize the random number generator.

* | **append_to_count_output_data**: bool = False
  | Used for checkpointing, instead of creating new files for Count observables data, 
  | new values are appended to the existing files. If such files do not exist, new files are
  | created.

* | **continue_after_sigalrm**: bool = False
  | MCell registers a SIGALRM signal handler. When SIGALRM signal is received and 
  | continue_after_sigalrm is False, checkpoint is stored and simulation is terminated. 
  | When continue_after_sigalrm is True, checkpoint is stored and simulation continues.

Species
=======

There are three ways how to use this class\:
1) definition of simple species - in this case 'name' is 
a single identifier and at least 'diffusion_constant_2d' or 
'diffusion_constant_3d' must be provided.
Example\: m.Species('A', diffusion_constant_3d=1e-6). 
Such a definition must be added to subsystem or model so that  
during model initialization this species is transformed to MCell 
representation and an ElementaryMoleculeType 'A' with a given 
diffusion constant is created as well.
2) full definition of complex species - in this case the 
inherited attribute 'elementary_molecules' from Complex
is used as a definition of the complex and this gives information 
on diffusion constants of the used elementary molecules.
Example\: m.Species(elementary_molecules=[ei1, ei2]). 
Such a definition must be added to subsystem or model.   
3) declaration of species - in this case only 'name' in the form of 
an BNGL string is provided. The complex instance specified by the name 
must be fully qualified (i.e. all components are present and those 
components that have a state have their state set).
No information on diffusion constants and other properties of 
used elementary molecules is provided, it must be provided elsewhere.
Example\: m.Species('A(b!1).B(a!1)').
This is a common form of usage when reaction rules are provided in a BNGL file.
Such declaration does no need to be added to subsystem or model.
This form is used as argument in cases where a fully qualified instance  
must be provided such as in molecule releases.

Attributes:
***********
* | **name**: str = None
  | Name of the species in the BNGL format. 
  | One must either specify 'name' or 'elementary_molecules' 
  | (inherited from Complex). This argument 'name' is parsed during model 
  | initialization.

* | **diffusion_constant_2d**: float = None
  | This molecule is constrained to a surface and diffuses with diffusion constant D.

* | **diffusion_constant_3d**: float = None
  | This molecule diffuses in space with diffusion constant D. D can be zero, in which case the molecule doesnâ€™t move. The units of D are cm 2 /s.

* | **custom_time_step**: float = None
  | This molecule should take timesteps of length t (in seconds). Use either this or custom_time_step.

* | **custom_space_step**: float = None
  | This molecule should take steps of average length L (in microns). Use either this or custom_time_step.

* | **target_only**: bool = False
  | This molecule will not initiate reactions when it runs into other molecules. This
  | setting can speed up simulations when applied to a molecule at high concentrations 
  | that reacts with a molecule at low concentrations (it is more efficient for
  | the low-concentration molecule to trigger the reactions). This directive does
  | not affect unimolecular reactions.

* | **name**: str = None
  | When set, this complex instance is initialized from a BNGL string passed as this argument, 
  | the string is parsed during model initialization so the molecule types it uses
  | don't have to be defined before initialization.

* | **elementary_molecules**: List[ElementaryMolecule] = None
  | Individual molecule instances contained in the complex.

   * | file_name: str
   * | parameter_overrides: Dict[str, float] = None

  | Parses a BNGL file and only reads molecule types and
  | reaction rules sections, e.g. ignores observables. 
  | Parameter values are evaluated and the result value 
  | is directly used.  
  | Compartments names are stored in rxn rules as strings because
  | compartments belong to geometry objects and the subsystem is independent
  | on specific geometry.
  | However they must be defined on initialization.



SurfaceClass
============

Defining a surface class allows surfaces to behave like species (in a limited way).

Attributes:
***********
* | **name**: str
  | Name of the surface class

* | **properties**: List[SurfaceProperty] = None
  | A surface class can either have a list of properties or just one property.
  | In the usual case of having one property, one can set the attributes 
  | type, affected_species, etc. inherited from SurfaceProperty directly.

* | **type**: SurfacePropertyType = SurfacePropertyType.UNSET
  | Must be set.

* | **affected_complex_pattern**: Complex = None
  | A complex pattern with optional orientation must be set.
  | Default orientation means that the pattern matches any orientation.
  | For concentration or flux clamp the orientation specifies on which side  
  | will be the concentration held 
  | (UP is front or outside, DOWN is back or inside, and DEFAULT, ANY or NONE is on both sides).
  | The complex pattern must not have any compartment.

* | **concentration**: float = None
  | Specifies concentration when type is SurfacePropertyType.CLAMP_CONCENTRATION or 
  | SurfacePropertyType.CLAMP_FLUX. Represents concentration of the imagined opposide side 
  | of the wall that has this concentration or flux clamped.

***********
* | **type**: SurfacePropertyType = SurfacePropertyType.UNSET
  | Must be set.

* | **affected_complex_pattern**: Complex = None
  | A complex pattern with optional orientation must be set.

  | For concentration or flux clamp the orientation specifies on which side  
  | will be the concentration held 
  | (UP is front or outside, DOWN is back or inside, and DEFAULT, ANY or NONE is on both sides).
  | The complex pattern must not have any compartment.

* | **concentration**: float = None
