      Generates the last visualization and reaction output (if they were defined), then
      flushes all buffers and optionally prints simulation report. 
      Buffers are also flushed when the Model object is destroyed.

      If file is not set, then uses the first VizOutput to determine the target directory 
      and creates name using the cutrrent iteration. Fails if argument file is not set and there is no VizOutput.
      Must be called after initialization.
      Always exports the current state, i.e. with the current . 
      Events (ReleaseSites and VizOutputs) with scheduled time other than zero cannot be imported correectly yet.
