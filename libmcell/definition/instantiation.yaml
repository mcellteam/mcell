  items:
  - name: complex
    type: Complex*
    doc: | 
      Complex instance defining the molecule that will be released.
      Orientation of the complex instance is used to define orientation of the released molecule,
      when Orientation.DEFAULT is set, volume molecules are released with Orientation.NONE and
      surface molecules are released with Orientation.UP.
      Compartment must not be set because this specific release definition states the location.  
      
  - name: location
    type: List[float]
    doc: |
