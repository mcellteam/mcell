    doc: | 
      During a train of releases, release molecules after every t seconds. 
      Default is to release only once.

    type: float
    default: TIME_INFINITY
    doc: |
      A new train of releases happens every t seconds. 
      Default is to never have a new train. 
      The train interval must not be shorter than the train duration.
  
  - name: number_of_trains
    type: int
    default: 1 
    doc: | 
      Repeat the release process for n trains of releases. Default is one train.

SingleMoleculeReleaseInfo:
  superclass: BaseDataClass
  items:
  - name: species
    type: Species*
    doc: | 
      The species of the molecule that will be released.

  - name: location
    type: Vec3
    doc: | 
      3D position where the molecule will be released. 
      If a molecule has a 2D diffusion constant, it will be
      placed on the surface closest to the coordinate given. 

  - name: orientation
    type: Orientation
    default: Orientation.NONE
    doc: |
      Must be set if the species represent surface molecules.

  - name: name
    type: str
    doc: Name of the release site
    
  - name: species
    type: Species*
    default: unset
    doc: | 
      The species of the molecule that will be released. Not used for the LIST shape. 
      You must specify an orientation if the molecule is a surface molecule.
      Must be set when molecule_list is empty and unset when molecule_list is not empty.

  - name: orientation
    type: Orientation
    default: Orientation.NONE
    doc: |
      Must be set if the species represent surface molecules.
      
  - name: molecule_list
    type: List[SingleMoleculeReleaseInfo*]
    default: empty
    doc: |
      Used for LIST shape release mode. 

  - name: release_time
    type: float
    default: 0
    doc: | 
      Specifies time in seconds when the release event is executed.
      In case when a release pattern is used, this is the time of the first release.      
      Equivalent to MDL's RELEASE_PATTERN command DELAY.

  - name: release_pattern
    type: ReleasePattern*
    default: unset 
    doc: | 
      Use the release pattern to define schedule of releases. 
      The default is to release the specified number of molecules at the set release_time. 

  - name: shape
    type: Shape
    default: Shape.UNSET
    doc: |
      Set automatically when 
    
  - name: region
    type: Region*
    default: unset
    doc: Sets shape to Shape.REGION_EXPR. 

  - name: location
    type: Vec3 # Vec3 and Vec2 are built-in data types
    default: unset # null is equivalent to None in YAML
    
  - name: site_diameter
    type: float
    default: 0
    doc: |
      For a geometrical release site, this releases molecules uniformly within
      a radius r. Not used for releases on regions.
      Usually required for Shape.List type of releases.
    
  # do we need radius when we have diameter?
  - name: site_radius
    type: float

      For a geometrical release site, this releases molecules uniformly within
      a radius r. Not used for releases on regions.
