    There are three ways how to use this class\:
    1) definition of simple species - in this case 'name' is 
    a single identifier and at least 'diffusion_constant_2d' or 
    'diffusion_constant_3d' must be provided.
    Example\: m.Species('A', diffusion_constant_3d=1e-6). 
    Such a definition must be added to subsystem or model so that  
    during model initialization this species is transformed to MCell 
    representation and an ElementaryMoleculeType 'A' with a given 
    diffusion constant is created as well.
    2) full definition of complex species - in this case the 
    inherited attribute 'elementary_molecule_instances' from ComplexInstance
    is used as a definition of the complex and this gives information 
    on diffusion constants of the used elementary molecules.
    Example\: m.Species(elementary_molecule_instances=[ei1, ei2]). 
    Such a definition must be added to subsystem or model.   
    3) declaration of species - in this case only 'name' in the form of 
    an BNGL string is provided. The complex instance specified by the name 
    must be fully qualified (i.e. all components are present and those 
    components that have a state have their state set).
    No information on diffusion constants and other properties of 
    used elementary molecules is provided, it must be provided elsewhere.
    Example\: m.Species('A(b!1).B(a!1)').
    This is a common form of usage when reaction rules are provided in a BNGL file.
    Such declaration does no need to be added to subsystem or model.
    This form is used as argument in cases where a fully qualified instance  
    must be provided such as in molecule releases.

       initialization.
