      TODO - Right now, contains only position of this is a volume molecule 
      Contains position in space both for surface and volume molecules,
      it won't be possible to change it for surface molecules.
       
      
  - name: orientation
    type: Orientation
    default: Orientation.NOT_SET
    doc: |
      Contains orientation for surface molecule. Volume molecules 
      have always orientation set to Orientation.NONE.
      
  methods:
  - name: remove
    # TODO: better name?
    doc: | 
      Removes this molecule from simulation. Any subsequent modifications
      of this object won't have any effect.

    doc: Normal of this wall, no guarantees on the length of this vector are given. 

  - name: is_movable
    type: bool
    default: true
    doc: | 
       If True, whis wall can be moved through Model.apply_vertex_moves,
       if False, wall moves are ignored.
