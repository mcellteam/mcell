    - name: REFLECTIVE
      value: 2
      doc: |
         If used as a surface property for a volume molecule it is reflected by any surface with
         this surface class. This is the default behavior for volume molecules.
         If used for a surface molecule it is reflected by the border of the
         surface with this surface class. 
         Setting orientation in affected_complex_pattern allows selective reflection of volume 
         molecules from only the front or back of a surface or selective reflection of surface 
         molecules with only a certain orientation from the surface’s border. 
         Using m.ALL_MOLECULES as affected_complex_pattern has the effect that all 
         volume molecules are reflected by surfaces with this surface class and all surface molecules 
         are reflected by the border of the surfaces with this surface class. 
         Using m.ALL_VOLUME_MOLECULES as affected_complex_pattern has the effect that all
         volume molecules are reflected by surfaces with this surface class. 
         Using m.ALL_SURFACE_MOLECULES as affected_complex_pattern has the effect that all
         surface molecules are reflected by the border of the surface with this surface class.
         
    - name: TRANSPARENT
      value: 3
      doc: |
         If used as a surface property for a volume molecule it passes through all surfaces with
         this surface class.  
         If used for a surface molecule it passes through the border of the surface with this surface 
         class. This is the default behavior for surface molecules.
         Setting orientation in affected_complex_pattern allows selective transparency of volume 
         molecules from only the front or back of a surface or selective transparency for surface 
         molecules with only a certain orientation from the surface’s border. 
         To make a surface with this surface class transparent to all volume molecules,
         use m.ALL_VOLUME_MOLECULES for affected_complex_pattern. 
         To make a border of the surface with this surface class transparent to all surface molecules,
         use m.ALL_SURFACE_MOLECULES for the affected_complex_pattern. 
         Using m.ALL_MOLECULES for affected_complex_pattern has the effect that surfaces with this surface class 
         are transparent to all volume molecules and borders of the surfaces with this surface class are 
         transparent to all surface molecules. 
            
    - name: ABSORPTIVE
      value: 4
      doc: |
         If affected_complex_pattern refers to a volume molecule it is destroyed if it touches surfaces with this surface class. 
         If affected_complex_pattern refers to a surface molecule it is destroyed if it touches the border of the surface with 
         this surface class, i.e., it is allowed to release surface molecules on absorptive surfaces, they get destroyed only
         when they touch the border of this surface. 
         Tick marks on name allow destruction from only one side of the surface for volume molecules or selective destruction 
         for surface molecules on the surfaces’s border based on their orientation. 
         To make a surface with this surface class absorptive to all volume molecules, m.ALL_VOLUME_MOLECULES 
         can be used for affected_complex_pattern. 
         To make a border of the surface with this surface class absorptive to all surface molecules,
         m.ALL_SURFACE_MOLECULES can be used for name. 
         Using m.ALL_MOLECULES as affected_complex_pattern has the effect that surfaces with this surface
         class are absorptive for all volume molecules and borders of the surfaces with this surface class 
         are absorptive for all surface molecules.
         
    - name: CONCENTRATION_CLAMP
      value: 5 
      doc: | 
         Clamps concentration at a surface by periodically releasing molecules that correspond
         to the wall being a transparent boundary to the area with given concentration, 
         and by absorbing all molecules that hit this surface.  
         The molecules matching affected_complex_pattern are destroyed if they touch the surface (as if they
         had passed through), and new molecules are created at the surface, as if molecules had passed through 
         from the other side at a concentration value (units = M). 
         Orientation marks may be used; in this case, the other side of the surface is reflective. 
         Note that this command is only used to set the effective concentration of a volume molecule at a surface; 
         it is not valid to specify a surface molecule. 

    - name: FLUX_CLAMP
      value: 6 
      doc: | 
         Clamps flux at a surface by periodically releasing molecules that correspond
