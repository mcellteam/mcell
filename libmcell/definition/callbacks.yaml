     type: GeometryObject*
     doc: Object that was hit.
     
   - name: wall_index
     type: int
     doc: Index of wall belonging to the geometry_object.

   - name: time_before_hit
     type: float
     doc: |
        Time when the molecule started to diffuse towards the hit wall. 
        It is either the start of the molecule's diffusion or 
        if a wall was hit later then the time of last wall hit.

ReactionInfo:
   doc: Data structure passed to a reaction callback. 
   items:
   - name: type
     type: ReactionType
     doc: |
        Specifies whether the reaction is unimolecular or bimolecular and
        also provides information in reactant types. 
   
   - name: reactant_ids
     type: List[int]
     doc: | 
        IDs of the reacting molecules, contains 1 ID for a unimolecular reaction, 2 IDs for a bimolecular reaction.
        For a bimolecular reaction, the first ID is always the molecule that was diffused and the second one 
        is the molecule that was hit.

     type: ReactionRule*
     doc: Reaction rule of the reaction.

   - name: time
     type: float
     doc: Time of the reaction
     
   - name: pos3d
     type: Vec3 
     doc: |
        Specifies where reaction occured in the 3d space, specific meaning depends on the reaction type\:
        - unimolecular reaction - position of the reacting molecule,
        - volume-volume or surface-surface reaction - position of the first reactant,
        - volume-surface reaction - position where the volume molecule hit the wall with the surface molecule.
     
   - name: geometry_object
     type: GeometryObject*
     default: unset
     doc: |
        Set only for surface reactions.
        Object on whose surface where the reaction occured.
      
   - name: wall_index
     type: int
     default: -1
     doc: |
        Set only for surface reactions.
        Index of wall belonging to the geometry_object where the reaction occured, 
        i.e. where the volume molecule hit the wall with a surface molecule or
        wall where the diffusing surface reactant reacted.
    
   - name: pos2d
     type: Vec2 
     default: unset
     doc: |
        Set only for surface reactions.
        Specifies where reaction occured in the 2d UV coordinates defined by the wall where the reaction occured, 
        specific meaning depends on the reaction type\:
        - unimolecular reaction - position of the reacting molecule,
        - volume-surface and surface-surface reaction - position of the second reactant.
          
   - name: geometry_object_surf_reac2
     type: GeometryObject*
     default: unset
     doc: |
        Set only for surface-surface reactions.
        Object on whose surface was the second surface reactant located when reaction occured.
      
   - name: wall_index_surf_reac2
     type: int
     default: -1
     doc: |
        Set only for surface-surface reactions
        Index of wall belonging to the geometry_object where the
        second surface reactant located when reaction occured.
    
   - name: pos2d_surf_reac2
     type: Vec2 
     default: unset
     doc: |
        Set only for surface-surface reactions.
        Specifies 2d UV coordinates of the second reactant.
