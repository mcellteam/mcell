        Not completely sure how to deal with geometry objects introspection
        on the API side, whether we should have a 'global' view on all walls and 
        vertices or we should somehow keep hierarchy object - wall - vertex

        Time when the molecule started to diffuse towards the hit wall. 
        It is either the start of the molecule's diffusion or 
        if a wall was hit later then the time of last wall hit.
