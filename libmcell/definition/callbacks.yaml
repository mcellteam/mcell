MolWallHitInfo:
   items:
   - name: molecule_id
     type: int
     doc: Id of molecule that hit the wall.
     
   - name: geometry_object
     type: GeometryObject*
     doc: Object that was hit.
     
   - name: wall_index
     type: int
     doc: Index of the wall belonging to the geometry_object.
   
   - name: time
     type: float
     doc: Time of the hit.
      
   - name: pos3d
     type: Vec3
     doc: Position of the hit.
     
   - name: time_before_hit
     type: float
     doc: |
        The time when the molecule started to diffuse towards the hit wall. 
        It is either the start of the molecule's diffusion or 
        when the molecule reflected from another wall.
          
   - name: pos3d_before_hit
     type: Vec3
     doc: Position of the molecule at time_before_hit.
      
      
ReactionInfo:
   doc: Data structure passed to a reaction callback. 
   items:
   - name: type
     type: ReactionType
     doc: |
        Specifies whether the reaction is unimolecular or bimolecular and
        also provides information on reactant types. 
   
   - name: reactant_ids
     type: List[int]
     doc: | 
        IDs of the reacting molecules, contains 1 ID for a unimolecular or a molecule+surface class reaction, 
        2 IDs for a bimolecular reaction.
        For a bimolecular reaction, the first ID is always the molecule that diffused and the second one 
        is the molecule that was hit.
        IDs can be used to obtain the location of the molecules. The position of the first molecule obtained through 
        model.get_molecule() is the position of the diffusing molecule before the collision.
        All the reactants are removed after return from this callback, unless they are kept by the reaction such as A in A + B -> A + C.  

   - name: product_ids
     type: List[int]
     doc: | 
       IDs of reaction product molecules. They already exist in the simulated system together with reactants; however reactants 
       will be removed after return from this callback. 
   
   - name: reaction_rule
     type: ReactionRule*
     doc: Reaction rule of the reaction that occured.
     
   - name: time
     type: float
     doc: Time of the reaction.
     
   - name: pos3d
     type: Vec3 
     doc: |
        Specifies where reaction occurred in the 3d space, the specific meaning depends on the reaction type\:
        - unimolecular reaction - position of the reacting molecule,
        - volume-volume or surface-surface reaction - position of the first reactant,
        - volume-surface reaction - position where the volume molecule hit the wall with the surface molecule.
     
   - name: geometry_object
     type: GeometryObject*
     default: unset
     doc: |
        The object on whose surface where the reaction occurred.
        Set only for surface reactions or reactions with surface classes.
      
   - name: wall_index
     type: int
     default: -1
     doc: |
        Set only for surface reactions or reactions with surface classes.
        Index of wall belonging to the geometry_object where the reaction occured, 
        i.e. wall where a volume molecule hit the surface molecule or
        wall where the diffusing surface reactant reacted.
    
   - name: pos2d
     type: Vec2 
     default: unset
     doc: |
        Set only for surface reactions or reactions with surface classes.
        Specifies where reaction occurred in the 2d UV coordinates defined by the wall where the reaction occured, 
        the rspecific meaning depends on the reaction type\:
        - unimolecular reaction - position of the reacting molecule,
        - volume-surface and surface-surface reaction - position of the second reactant.
