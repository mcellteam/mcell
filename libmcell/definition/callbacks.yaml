   - name: geometry_object
     type: GeometryObject*
     doc: Object that was hit.
     
   - name: wall_index
     type: int
     doc: Index of wall belonging to the geometry_object.

   - name: time_before_hit
     type: float
     doc: |
        Time when the molecule started to diffuse towards the hit wall. 
        It is either the start of the molecule's diffusion or 
        if a wall was hit later then the time of last wall hit.

ReactionInfo:
   doc: Data structure passed to a reaction callback. 
   items:
   - name: reactant_ids
     type: List[int]
     doc: | 
        IDs of the reacting molecules, contains 1 ID for a unimolecular reaction, 2 IDs for a bimolecular reaction.
        For a bimolecular reaction, the first ID is always the molecule that was diffused and the second one 
        is the molecule that was hit.

     type: ReactionRule*
     doc: Reaction rule of the reaction.

        Object on whose surface where the reaction occured.
      
   - name: wall_index
     type: int

     doc: |
        Set only for surface reactions
        Index of wall belonging to the geometry_object where the reacton occured.

        Set only for surface reactions
        Position of the reaction in the 2D uv coordinates defined by the wall where the reaction occured.
