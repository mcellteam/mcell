      Diffusing surface molecules will interact with surface molecules on other

      Normally, a reaction will not proceed on a surface unless there
      is room to place all products on the single grid element where
      the reaction is initiated. By increasing r from its default value
      of 0, one can specify how far from the reactionâ€™s location, in microns, the
      reaction can place its products. To be useful, r must
      be larger than the longest axis of the grid element on the triangle
      in question. The reaction will then proceed if there is room to
      place its products within a radius r, and will place those products as 
      close as possible to the place where the reaction occurs
      (deterministically, so small-scale directional bias is possible).
