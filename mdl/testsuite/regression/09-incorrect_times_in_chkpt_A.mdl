/****************************************************************************
 * Regression test 09: Checkpoint file contains incorrect simulation times.
 *                     (part 1 -- create checkpoint file)
 *
 *    This is a bug encountered by Jacob Czech (2009-01-16).  When a checkpoint
 *    file is created, if the time step has been changed between saving and
 *    loading the checkpoint, an incorrect "current time" is stored into the
 *    checkpoint file.  This will not have any immediate adverse effects; if,
 *    however, the simulation, after loading from the checkpoint, checkpoints
 *    again and reloads, times listed in the reaction data output files will be
 *    incorrect!
 *
 *    Failure: Times jump from 1.5e-6 to 2.2e-6
 *    Success: Times jump from 1.5e-6 to 1.7e-6
