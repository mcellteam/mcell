/**********************************************************************
*  Regression test 29: This test checks the correct use of FOREVER
*                       as optimization design tool.
*
*  There was a bug reported by Jacob Czech about reactions stalling.
*  The study finds a bug in the use of FOREVER constant in the
*  context of unimolecular reactions.
*
*  Failure: The equilibrium number of molecules "S1{-1}" is exactly
*           equal to the initial value (reactions stalled)
*  Success: The equilibrium number of molecules "S1{-1}" is about the half
*            of the initial value.
