/****************************************************************************
* Regression test 28: The results of unimolecular reaction with variable 
*                     rection rate were incorrect due to the bug.
*
*  This is a bug encountered by Jun Ma.  It represents itself as molecule's
*  negative lifetime. It happened under two simultaneous conditions:
*  checkpointing and unimolecular reactions with variable rates.
*  It appeared that variable rates files were not properly read and
*  and molecule's scheduling times were not properly set up.
*  For this test file the bug showed up as number of molecules B
*  equal to 10 right after checkpoint.
*
*  Failure: final number of molecules B is 10
*  Success: final number of molecules B is less than 10
