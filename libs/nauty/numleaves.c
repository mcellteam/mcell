/* This is a sample function to show how copyg can be compiled
   as a filter.  This one defines the filter to be TRUE if
   the graph has between Qlo and Qhi leaves.  Outdegree=1 counts
   as a leaf in the case of digraphs.

   To compile this into a program "numleaves", use this:
     gcc -o numleaves -O3 -DFILTER=numleaves copyg.c numleaves.c nauty.a
   or similarly with a different compiler.

   At execution time, the interval [Qlo,Qhi] is taken from the -Q switch.
   A missing lower bound is indicated by Qlo = -NOLIMIT and a missing
   upper bound by Qhi = NOLIMIT.
