Cloned on June 9, 2020 from https://github.com/pybind/pybind11.git, 
tag v2.2.4, hash 9a19306

CMake on MacOS is unable to find pybind installed in anaconda and
building pybind11 along with other sources seems to be the common approach 
(e.g. in Gamer)  

Also neede to use an older version because for version 2.5.0 build on MacOS 
reported Unsupported compiler -- pybind11 requires C++11 support
