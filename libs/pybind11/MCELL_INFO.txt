Cloned on Dec 12, 2020 from https://github.com/pybind/pybind11.git, 
tag v2.6.1, hash f1abf5d

CMake on MacOS is unable to find pybind installed in anaconda and
building pybind11 along with other sources seems to be the common approach 
(e.g. in Gamer)  

Not stripping the resulting library for now due to linking errors
- change in pybind11/tools/pybind11Tools.cmake - see NO STRIP
