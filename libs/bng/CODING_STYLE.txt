Naming:

These terms repeat very often:
 - complex - always Cplx/cplx
 - molecule - always Mol/mol
 - reaction - Rxn/rxn
 - context  - Ctx/ctx
 
These cannot be made much shorter:
 - component - Component/component
 - compartment - Compartment/compartment
 
 
Complexes:
 - use Cplx/cplx where possible, 
   - adding 'instance' such as in cplx_instance does not add any information and is discouraged
   - adding 'pattern' cplx_pattern specifies that the cplx is used as pattern and should be used in such cases
