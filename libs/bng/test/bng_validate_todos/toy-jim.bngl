# The model consists of a monovalent extracellular ligand, 
# a monovalent cell-surface receptor, a bivalent cytosolic adapter protein, 
# and a cytosolic kinase.  The receptor dimerizes through a 
# receptor-receptor interaction that depends on ligand binding.  
# The adapter binds the receptor and the kinase.  
# When two kinases are juxtaposed through binding to 
# receptor-associated adapter proteins, one of the kinases can 
# transphosphorylate the second kinase.
