CHANGELOG
===============================================================================

Changes in MCell 3.5.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Major changes:
  * Integration of mesh processing tool GAMer 2

* Bug Fixes:
  * Fixed multiple surface-surface reaction handling when the reactions had the same reactants
  * Fixed MCell-R conversion step when the number of molecules to release was 0

* Minor changes:
  * MCell-R/NFsim now prints out less messages


Changes in MCell 3.5.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Requirements:
  * BNGL style reactions (MCell-R) require Perl to be installed, Windows variant is known to work with Perl from strawberryper.com and must be as the first perl.exe in PATH 
  * To use Matplotlib, Debian 9 and 10 require package 'tk' to be installed; instead of installing it, it is possible to run export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:`pwd`/2.79/python/lib/ in Blender-2.79-CellBlender before running the ./blender executable     

* Known limitations:
  * Windows build does not contain GAMER plugin for mesh refinement
  * Older settings might interfere on Windows, to fix this, please erase C:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation
  * MacOS version must be extracted into the /Applications/ directory manually and must be run from terminal with working directory being the root directory '/' 
  
* Major changes:
  * NFSim reaction engine gets the same seed as mcell, no longer it generates its seed from current time 
  * Several improvements in CellBlender plugin with regards to BNGL type reactions
  * Automated build and test system

* Bug Fixes:
  * Fixed several issues for BNGL type reactions in compartments support 
  * Fixed case when memory usage grew indefinitely when logging BNGL type reactions
  * Fixed variable release scheduling rate when checkpoint with different timestep is loaded
  
* Optimizations:
  * Optimized search in nfSim reaction cache (up to 2x speedup for some MCellR models)
